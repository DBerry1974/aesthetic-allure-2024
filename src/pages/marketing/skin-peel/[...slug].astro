      Skin peel treatments, also known as chemical peels, have become increasingly popular as a way to transform the look and feel of your skin. This non-invasive procedure is a great way to reduce visible signs of ageing and improve the overall tone and texture of your skin.

This process can be performed on the face, neck, hands, and other areas of the body to achieve a more youthful look.

    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The strength of the peel solution used will determine how long it is left on your skin before being neutralized and rinsed with water. Depending on the type of peel used, you may experience mild to moderate stinging or a slight burning sensation. After the procedure, your skin may become dry and sensitive, and it is important to follow any post-care instructions given by your doctor.

      The results of a skin peel treatment can vary depending on the depth of the peel and what type of solution was used. Generally, a series of treatments are needed to achieve the desired results. Skin peels can help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, age spots, and other discolouration while improving skin tone and texture.

          A skin peel treatment helps to improve the texture of the skin by exfoliating and removing the outermost layers of dead or damaged skin cells. This can lead to a smoother, softer, and more even-looking complexion. The treatment also encourages new cell growth, resulting in healthier-looking skin that feels softer and looks more radiant.

    Skin peel treatments are a popular way to help improve skin tone and texture, as well as reduce the appearance of wrinkles, age spots, and other skin imperfections. Depending on the type of skin peel treatment used, the procedure can range from mild exfoliation to deep resurfacing. 
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    Before undergoing a skin peel treatment, patients should discuss their goals with a qualified health provider. This will help determine the right type of peel for the patient's skin and the expected results. 
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    During a skin peel treatment, patients may experience a mild to moderate tingling sensation on their skin. Depending on the type of peel used, there may also be some discomfort associated with the procedure. A topical anaesthetic or cooling device can be used to minimize any discomfort associated with the treatment. 
</p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    The solution used in skin peel treatments is typically left on for a few minutes before being neutralized and rinsed off with water. Patients should follow their health provider's instructions closely, as leaving the solution on too long could cause irritation or burning. 
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
  After the skin peel treatment, a healing and moisturizing cream will be applied to the area. Sun protection is also important to prevent further damage from ultraviolet (UV) rays. In most cases, patients can expect mild to moderate redness and peeling of the skin for up to 10 days following the procedure. Patients may also experience some sensitivity to sunlight and other environmental stressors during this time.

      Skin peels, also known as chemical peels, are a popular cosmetic treatment used to improve the appearance and texture of the skin. Skin peels involve applying a chemical solution to remove damaged or dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. Depending on the strength of the peel, different types of treatments can be used.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Light peels, or superficial peels, are the most common type of skin peel. These treatments use milder acids such as glycolic acid and lactic acid to remove the outermost layer of skin cells. This type of treatment is great for lightening age spots and fine lines, improving skin texture, and evening out skin tone.    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Medium peels are a bit more aggressive and are used to treat deeper wrinkles and skin discolouration. These treatments use stronger acids such as trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or salicylic acid, which penetrate deeper into the skin to remove damaged layers of skin cells.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Deep peels are the strongest type of skin peel treatment and are used to treat severe wrinkles, discolouration, and sun damage. These peels use Phenol or TCA solutions which can penetrate deeper into the skin for longer-lasting results. Deep peels should only be performed by a professional with extensive experience in administering chemical peels.
