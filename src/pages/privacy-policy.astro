      advertising cookies by visiting
      http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices. However, we would
      prefer if you didn't do this, as advertising helps to keep much of the
      internet free. It's worth noting that opting out of advertising cookies
      will not stop you from seeing ads, but they won't be tailored to you
      anymore.
    </p>

      enable us to show you special offers and encourage you to revisit our
      site. However, this process is entirely anonymized, and we cannot
      proactively reach out to you. You can opt-out of these cookies anytime as
      explained above.

    <p>
      It may be that your concern around cookies relates to so-called �spyware�.
      Rather than switching off cookies in your browser, you may find that
      anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically
      deleting cookies considered to be invasive.
