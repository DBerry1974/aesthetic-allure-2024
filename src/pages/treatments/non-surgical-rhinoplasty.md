Non-surgical rhinoplasty is a relatively simple procedure that uses dermal fillers to temporarily alter the shape of one's nose without requiring surgery. Dermal fillers, such as hyaluronic acid, are injected into targeted areas of the nose to improve its shape. Patients may choose this option to address several issues, such as a crooked or asymmetrical nose, bumps on the bridge, humps in the profile, and other imperfections. Dermal fillers can also be used to augment and sculpt certain facial features.
