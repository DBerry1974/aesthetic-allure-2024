PRP Vampire facial is an incredibly popular treatment that has been growing in popularity among the beauty and wellness communities. PRP therapy, or Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy, is used to trick the body into healing and repairing itself by introducing a high concentration of platelets, growth factors, and stem cells into the skin.

This helps to stimulate collagen and elastin production, increasing cell turnover to reduce the appearance of pores, blur acne scarring, and give your complexion an overall healthy glow.
