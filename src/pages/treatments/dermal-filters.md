## About Dermal Fillers

Dermal fillers are a popular solution for those looking to restore volume, definition and hydration to their facial features.

Dermal fillers are made from hyaluronic acid, which is found naturally in the body, and when injected into target areas, they draw in water and moisture to plump up the skin. Dermal fillers can help to reduce wrinkles, lift flatter areas and refresh your overall look.

By choosing Dermal Fillers you can make sure that your skin looks its best by restoring volume and definition. Dermal fillers are a safe and effective cosmetic solution to help you achieve the look you desire.

## Treatment areas for Dermal Fillers 

### Cheek

Dermal fillers can be used to create a beautiful and contoured cheek, giving the face a more feminine look while also restoring lost cheekbone volume as we age. Dermal fillers provide subtle yet effective results by enhancing the cheekbone area, resulting in improved features such as nose-to-mouth lines for a smoother and more youthful look.

### Chin

Dermal fillers are an effective treatment used to provide a more defined profile, particularly for those with relatively small or flat chins. Dermal Fillers can help create a more feminine, v-shaped facial contour for women and a stronger, more prominent and masculine shape for men. Dermal Filler treatments involve the injection of Dermal Fillers into the chin area. This helps to provide the desired contouring effect.

### Jawline

The jawline treatment with Dermal Fillers is popular among both men and women, as it helps to subtly contour the face and create a more chiselled profile that gives a more sculpted look. Dermal Filler is injected into the area around the jawline angle with a safe cannula to increase the volume and enhance the definition of the jawbone. The results can last for up to 9-12 months before additional Dermal Filler injections are needed to refresh your look.

### Lips

Dermal Fillers are a popular choice for those seeking a fuller, more youthful-looking pout.
Dermal fillers can be used to create subtle enhancements to naturally thin lips or to restore volume and shape that have been lost due to the natural ageing process.

The effects of HA Dermal Fillers usually last for about six months and then can be touched up as needed to retain the desired volume and shape. We offer a range of Dermal Fillers, so you can easily select the best option to achieve your desired look.

### Nasolabial folds (nose to mouth lines)

Nasolabial folds, sometimes known as nose-to-mouth lines, are creases or wrinkles that form between the nose and corners of the mouth.

It is a common part of the ageing process, occurring as collagen breaks down in the face with a loss of elasticity. Dermal fillers are one type of cosmetic procedure used to reduce the appearance of these lines and wrinkles, by replenishing the volume of the skin in this area.

The fillers help to "plump" up the skin so that fine lines and deep wrinkles appear smoother. Dermal fillers are a safe, non-invasive way to combat nasolabial folds and restore a more youthful look to your face.

### Marionettes (sad / down-turned mouth) 

Dermal fillers made with hyaluronic acid can be a great way to treat marionette lines, also known as sad or down-turned mouth.
These lines are often caused by the loss of volume due to ageing or sun damage and the pull of the depressor muscle attached to the edge of the lips.

Dermal fillers can be injected below the corners of the mouth to lift your smile and fill out minor creases.
We often combine this treatment with a small anti-wrinkle injection to help stop the pull of the depressor muscle as well. There is no downtime for this treatment and results are usually immediate, lasting up to 12 months or longer.
