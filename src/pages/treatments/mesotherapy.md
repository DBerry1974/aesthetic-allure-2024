Mesotherapy is a safe and highly effective treatment for reducing the appearance of superficial wrinkles and rejuvenating dull, tired-looking skin. Derived from the French term 'mesoth√©rapie', it involves injecting a multivitamin solution directly into the dermis layer of the skin.

The procedure works by providing essential nutrients to the skin, leading to improved texture and tone. It can also be used to complement other aesthetic treatments, such as peels, anti-wrinkle injections, and Dermal Fillers.
