HIFU skin tightening is a revolutionary, non-invasive treatment that uses high-intensity focused ultrasound to target multiple depths in the bodyâ€™s tissue for skin tightening, lifting and body contouring.

HIFU works by boosting new collagen production and collagen regeneration at the source, providing excellent results without having to go through surgery or downtime. Because of its quick and easy nature, HIFU is often referred to as the 'Lunchtime Face Lift'. Dermal fillers can be used in conjunction with HIFU skin tightening for even more dramatic results.
